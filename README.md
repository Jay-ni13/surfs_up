# Surfs_Up
## Project Overview
A budding entrepenuer is exploring weather data analysis to support their latest venture--a Surf and Shake shop on the island of Oahu in Hawai'i--and provide insight on prime beachfront locations to help attract investors to the project. 

## Resources
 - Data Source: National Weather Service files; climate_analysis.sqlite, hawaii.sqlite
 - Article: https://www.suitesandlobbies.com/best-time-to-visit-hawaii/
 - Software: Python v3.7.13, Jupyter Notebook v6.4.8, SQLite v3.39.4, VS Code v1.73.1

## Results
Analysis of the 6 year and 8 months dataset sourced from the National Weather Service indicates that on the island of Oahu:
 - The average temperature in June is 3.9째F higher than it is in December.
 - While their maximum temperatures are only 2째F apart, December's minimum temperature is 8째F lower than June's minimum temperature.
 - 75% of June's average temperature readings are in the mid to upper 70s, and 75% of December's average temperature readings are in the low to mid 70s; 3/4 of both months' readings also fall within a 4-5째F range.

## Summary
Our research also indicates that December is a key time for tourism on Oahu, while June is a slower time of year. However, when analyzing the island's rainfall patterns in these months, we learn that:
 - The average amount of rainfall in December is 1/3 higher than in June, even though June is the start of the Pacific's hurricane season.
 - December is also a peak time for winter weather, accompanied by large swells on Oahu's northern shores.

This avenue of investigation could be taken a step further by examining how the level of precipitation in June and December relate to higher/lower than normal temperatures, and how that might impact long-term location planning for the Surf and Shake Shop. Another point to consider would be launching two locations for the Surf and Shake Shop simultaneuously, one on the island's north shore for experienced surfers who flock to the island in December for the towering swells, and another on the south shore geared towards beginners and tourists visiting with their children on summer break in June.
